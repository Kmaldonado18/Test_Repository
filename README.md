Fintech Class 3 Activity
Hello, my name is Kelly Maldonado. I was born in Houston, went to Baylor to study Management and Finance, and graduated in 2013.
My career goals include getting back into the financial industry and incorporating more technology, as I would like to learn more about blockchain and cryptocurrrency.
I chose FinTech as a career path because I enjoy learning and being challenged.
